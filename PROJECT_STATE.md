# Project State

**Purpose:** This file helps AI agents (Cursor, Aider, etc.) and humans remember what the project is about and what to work on next. Update it at the end of a session or when switching focus.

---

## For Aider (and other agents)

When you start a session with this repo:

1. **Read this file first** to get current focus and next steps.
2. **Read AGENTS.md** for workflow (beads, commits, push, no Co-authored-by, etc.).
3. After doing work, **update the sections below** so the next session knows:
   - What was last worked on
   - What’s in progress or planned next
   - Any open decisions or blockers

---

## Next / in progress
