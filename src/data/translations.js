Puedes jugar tú o activar el Modo IA: evalúa todas las posiciones posibles con una heurística + lookahead y elige el movimiento más estable (menos huecos, menos irregularidad, más líneas). Controles: ← → mover | ↑ girar | ↓ = dejar caer. Activa AI para ver el botón AI Move que elige la mejor colocación — ¡prueba hacer clic repetidamente para puntuar rápido!'

Después de más de diez años liderando equipos, clientes y proyectos como Fundador y CEO en el sector de la construcción, desarrollé una habilidad que hoy es mi mayor ventaja en tecnología: anticipar necesidades incluso antes de que el cliente las exprese. Tras completar el bootcamp intensivo de Ingeniería de Software de General Assembly y certificarme en IA con Python en Harvard (CS50), he creado aplicaciones full stack, productos digitales con visión y sistemas con inteligencia artificial aplicada. Me mueve construir herramientas que hagan la vida de las personas más fácil, más inteligente y más eficiente. Combino tecnología, diseño y negocio. Siempre con una mentalidad de producto.',

Estructuré HTML semántico y CSS responsivo asegurando accesibilidad y SEO. Creé experiencias dinámicas con JavaScript y eventos DOM. Back-end: Desarrollé aplicaciones seguras del lado del servidor usando Node.js, Express y Django siguiendo principios RESTful. Implementé operaciones CRUD y relaciones usando PostgreSQL y MongoDB con optimización de datos y ERDs. Habilitó comunicación API y autenticación basada en tokens. Prácticas de desarrollo: línea de comandos UNIX, control de versiones Git/GitHub, arquitectura MVC, programación asíncrona, TDD, debugging y documentación técnica.
