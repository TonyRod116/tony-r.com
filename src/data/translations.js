        description2: "Before moving into tech, I spent over 20 years in real estate and construction as a founder and operator, leading client-facing, high-value projects. That experience taught me how to understand business problems deeply, often before they are clearly defined, and translate ambiguity into clear, effective solutions.",
        description3: "After completing General Assembly's 420+ hour Software Engineering bootcamp, I built multiple end-to-end applications with a strong product and architecture mindset. My final project, TradeLab, was publicly recognized by my instructor as one of the best projects he had seen at GA. I later expanded my focus into applied AI through Harvard's CS50 AI and Stanford / DeepLearning.AI's Machine Learning specialization, applying AI to real operational use cases such as automation, data extraction, lead qualification, and decision support.",

I enjoy working at the intersection of business, customers, and technology—designing solutions that reduce friction, automate repetitive work, and deliver measurable results. I bring a founder mindset, strong communication skills, and real-world execution experience to every problem I work on."

If the correct digit is 7 and the model gives 90% confidence to 7, the loss is low. If it gives 10%, the loss is high. The goal of training is to minimize this number across all examples.' },

This makes training faster and more stable than basic gradient descent.' },

That experience shaped my strongest advantage today: understanding business and user needs deeply, often before they are clearly articulated, and turning ambiguity into clear, effective solutions.\n\nAfter graduating from General Assembly's 420+ hour Software Engineering Immersive, I built multiple end-to-end applications with a strong product and architecture mindset. My final project, TradeLab, a trading strategy backtesting platform, was publicly recognized by my instructor as one of the best projects he had seen at GA.\n\nI later expanded my technical scope through Harvard's CS50 AI and Stanford / DeepLearning.AI's Machine Learning specialization, applying AI to practical use cases such as automation, data extraction, lead qualification, and decision support.\n\nWhat drives me is impact. I enjoy working at the intersection of business, customers, and technology—designing solutions that save time, reduce friction, and help companies grow.

        description2: 'Antes de entrar en tecnología, pasé más de 20 años en bienes raíces y construcción como fundador y operador, liderando proyectos de alto valor orientados al cliente. Esa experiencia me enseñó a entender profundamente los problemas empresariales, a menudo antes de que estén claramente definidos, y a traducir la ambigüedad en soluciones claras y efectivas.',
        description3: 'Después de completar el bootcamp de Software Engineering de General Assembly de más de 420 horas, construí múltiples aplicaciones de extremo a extremo con una mentalidad sólida de producto y arquitectura. Mi proyecto final, TradeLab, fue reconocido públicamente por mi instructor como uno de los mejores proyectos que había visto en GA. Más tarde expandí mi enfoque hacia la IA aplicada a través de CS50 AI de Harvard y la especialización en Machine Learning de Stanford / DeepLearning.AI, aplicando IA a casos de uso operativos reales como automatización, extracción de datos, calificación de leads y soporte para la toma de decisiones.',
        description4: 'Lo que me impulsa es el impacto. Disfruto trabajando en la intersección de negocios, clientes y tecnología—diseñando soluciones que reducen la fricción, automatizan el trabajo repetitivo y ofrecen resultados medibles.

      aboutMeContent: 'Soy un Ingeniero de Soluciones enfocado en usar software, IA y automatización para resolver problemas empresariales reales e impulsar resultados medibles.\n\nAntes de hacer la transición a la tecnología, pasé más de una década como Fundador y CEO en el sector de la construcción, liderando proyectos de alto riesgo orientados al cliente. Esa experiencia moldeó mi mayor ventaja hoy: entender profundamente las necesidades empresariales y de los usuarios, a menudo antes de que estén claramente articuladas, y convertir la ambigüedad en soluciones claras y efectivas.\n\nDespués de graduarme del programa inmersivo de Software Engineering de General Assembly de más de 420 horas, construí múltiples aplicaciones de extremo a extremo con una mentalidad sólida de producto y arquitectura. Mi proyecto final, TradeLab, una plataforma de backtesting de estrategias de trading, fue reconocido públicamente por mi instructor como uno de los mejores proyectos que había visto en GA.\n\nMás tarde expandí mi alcance técnico a través de CS50 AI de Harvard y la especialización en Machine Learning de Stanford / DeepLearning.AI, aplicando IA a casos de uso prácticos como automatización, extracción de datos, calificación de leads y soporte para la toma de decisiones.\n\nLo que me impulsa es el impacto. Disfruto trabajando en la intersección de negocios, clientes y tecnología—diseñando soluciones que ahorran tiempo, reducen la fricción y ayudan a las empresas a crecer. Traigo una mentalidad de fundador, fuertes habilidades de comunicación y experiencia de ejecución en el mundo real a cada proyecto.',

Aquesta versió és una actualització amb física personalitzada i cervell d\'IA. Una peça — la T\' — té una mecànica especial: quan toca el terra es "dissol" i cada bloc cau verticalment fins trobar suport, omplint forats com sorra. Pots jugar tu o activar el Mode IA: avalua totes les posicions possibles amb una heurística + lookahead i tria el moviment més estable (menys forats, menys irregularitat, més línies). Controls: ← → moure | ↑ girar | ↓ = deixar caure. Activa AI per veure el botó AI Move que tria la millor col·locació — prova fer clic repetidament per puntuar ràpid!'

      aboutMeContent: 'Soc un Enginyer de Solucions enfocat en usar programari, IA i automatització per resoldre problemes empresarials reals i impulsar resultats mesurables.\n\nAbans de fer la transició a la tecnologia, vaig passar més d\'una dècada com a Fundador i CEO en el sector de la construcció, liderant projectes d\'alt risc orientats al client. Aquesta experiència va modelar el meu major avantatge avui: entendre profundament les necessitats empresarials i dels usuaris, sovint abans que estiguin clarament articulades, i convertir l\'ambigüitat en solucions clares i efectives.\n\nDesprés de graduar-me del programa immersiu d\'Enginyeria de Programari de General Assembly de més de 420 hores, vaig construir múltiples aplicacions d\'extrem a extrem amb una mentalitat sòlida de producte i arquitectura. El meu projecte final, TradeLab, una plataforma de backtesting d\'estratègies de trading, va ser reconegut públicament pel meu instructor com un dels millors projectes que havia vist a GA.\n\nMés tard vaig expandir el meu abast tècnic a través de CS50 AI de Harvard i l\'especialització en Machine Learning de Stanford / DeepLearning.AI, aplicant IA a casos d\'ús pràctics com automatització, extracció de dades, qualificació de leads i suport per a la presa de decisions.\n\nEl que em impulsa és l\'impacte. Gaudeixo treballant en la intersecció de negocis, clients i tecnologia—dissenyant solucions que estalvien temps, redueixen la fricció i ajuden a les empreses a créixer. Porto una mentalitat de fundador, forts habilitats de comunicació i experiència d\'execució en el món real a cada projecte.',
