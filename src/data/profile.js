  bio: {
    es: 'Soy un Full Stack Software Engineer con experiencia previa como emprendedor en el sector de la construcción y la digitalización. Mi camino hacia la programación comenzó en General Assembly, donde destaqué por ir siempre más allá de lo requerido en cada proyecto—añadiendo funcionalidades creativas, útiles y con visión de producto. Mi proyecto final, TradeLab, fue reconocido públicamente por mi profesor como uno de los mejores que había visto nunca en su experiencia docente en GA.',
    en: "I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with an entrepreneurial background in the construction and digitalization sector. My journey into software engineering began at General Assembly, where I stood out for consistently going beyond project requirements, adding creative, functional, and product-oriented features that elevated each build. My final project, TradeLab, was publicly recognized by my instructor as one of the best projects he had ever seen in his years of teaching at GA."
  },
  currentBio: "I'm a full stack software engineer who recently graduated from General Assembly, after several years leading projects and running client-centered businesses in real estate and construction. At GA I built four complete applications: my final project, TradeLab, was highlighted by my instructor as one of the best he had seen, and I found that what drives me most is using code creatively to solve problems. I enjoy looking beyond the obvious, understanding what people really need, and turning that into innovative, practical solutions. I bring curiosity, creativity, and a collaborative spirit to every project, and I'm excited to keep growing as an engineer while building products that genuinely improve the way people live and work.",
