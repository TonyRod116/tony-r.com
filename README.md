- **Project Selection:** Chose 3 most impactful projects demonstrating full-stack capabilities
- **Skill Categorization:** Organized technical skills by proficiency and relevance
- **SEO Optimization:** Planned meta tags, structured data, and performance optimization

## Build/Code Process

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
I started by setting up the project structure and core dependencies:

```javascript
// Vite configuration for optimal development experience
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    assetsDir: 'assets'
  }
})
```

**Key Implementation:**
- Configured Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- Set up TailwindCSS with custom configuration
- Implemented React Router for seamless navigation
- Created responsive layout foundation

### Phase 2: Component Architecture
Built reusable, maintainable components with clear separation of concerns:

```jsx
// Header component with responsive navigation
const Header = () => {
  const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false)
  const [isScrolled, setIsScrolled] = useState(false)
  const location = useLocation()

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => {
      setIsScrolled(window.scrollY > 20)
    }
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll)
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll)
  }, [])

  return (
    <motion.header
      initial={{ y: -100 }}
      animate={{ y: 0 }}
      className={`fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 transition-all duration-300 ${
        isScrolled 
          ? 'bg-white/80 dark:bg-gray-900/80 backdrop-blur-md border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700' 
          : 'bg-transparent'
      }`}
    >
      {/* Navigation implementation */}
    </motion.header>
  )
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Responsive navigation with mobile menu
- Smooth scroll-based header styling
- Dark mode support
- Accessibility compliance

### Phase 3: Data Management & Content
Created a centralized data structure for easy content management:

```javascript
// Profile data structure
export const profile = {
  name: 'Tony Rodríguez',
  title: 'Full Stack Software Engineer',
  email: 'tony.rod.bcn@gmail.com',
  location: 'Barcelona, Spain',
  github: 'https://github.com/TonyRod116',
  linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-rod/',
  skills: {
    languages: ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'SQL'],
    frameworks: ['React', 'Node.js', 'Express', 'Django', 'MongoDB', 'PostgreSQL'],
    tools: ['Git', 'GitHub', 'REST APIs', 'Netlify', 'Heroku', 'Neon.tech', 'Agile/Scrum'],
    soft: ['Creativity', 'Problem-Solving', 'Project management', 'Leadership', 'Client Relations']
  },
  // ... additional profile data
}
```

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for all content
- Easy updates and maintenance
- Type safety and consistency
- Scalable structure for future additions

### Phase 4: Project Showcase Implementation
Developed an engaging project showcase with detailed technical information:

```jsx
// Project card component with expandable content
const ProjectCard = ({ project, index }) => {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false)

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay: index * 0.1 }}
      className="group"
    >
      <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 overflow-hidden hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow h-full flex flex-col">
        <div className="relative h-80 bg-gradient-to-br from-primary-100 to-blue-100 dark:from-primary-900/20 dark:to-blue-900/20 overflow-hidden">
          <img 
            src={project.image} 
            alt={project.title}
            className="w-full h-full object-cover"
          />
          {/* Image overlay and badges */}
        </div>
        <div className="p-6 flex flex-col flex-1">
          {/* Project content with expandable descriptions */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Responsive image galleries
- Expandable project descriptions
- Technical stack visualization
- Interactive hover effects
- Mobile-optimized layouts

### Phase 5: Form Integration & Contact System
Implemented a robust contact system using Formspree:

```jsx
// Contact form with validation and submission handling
const Contact = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '', email: '', message: '', budget: '', availability: ''
  })
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false)
  const [submitStatus, setSubmitStatus] = useState('idle')

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    setIsSubmitting(true)
    setSubmitStatus('idle')

    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/mvgbjbvw', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData)
      })

      if (response.ok) {
        setSubmitStatus('success')
        setFormData({ name: '', email: '', message: '', budget: '', availability: '' })
      } else {
        setSubmitStatus('error')
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sending message:', error)
      setSubmitStatus('error')
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="space-y-6">
      {/* Form fields implementation */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Client-side validation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Spam protection via Formspree
- Professional form styling
- Accessibility compliance

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization
Optimized the application for production deployment:

```javascript
// Image optimization and lazy loading
import { projectImages } from '../assets/images.js'

// Vite automatically optimizes imported images
const ProjectCard = ({ project }) => (
  <img 
    src={projectImages[project.id]} 
    alt={project.title}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    loading="lazy"
  />
)
```
